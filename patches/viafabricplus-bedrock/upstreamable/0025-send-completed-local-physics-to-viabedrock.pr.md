# feat(movement): send completed local physics to ViaBedrock

## Purpose

Send the local player's position, predicted motion and swimming state after sendChanges and before Java CLIENT_TICK_END. Use the negotiated, versioned core channel on direct connections and ViaProxy. A stationary player still sends a fresh sample, so fluid gravity and pose transitions do not depend on Java's sparse position updates.

## Design constraints

Publish completed local physics once per client frame with matching context. Keep correction replay, item state, motion commands, teleport filtering, and actor ownership aligned with core.

Prerequisites:

- viabedrock/0092-retain-completed-client-prediction-frames.patch: Publish completed prediction, movement-effect history context and component replay before client frame integration.

- viabedrock/0103-honor-native-ability-layer-priority.patch: Apply native game-type transitions to historical Base and Spectator layers while preserving higher ability owners.

## Validation and remaining limits

Regression coverage includes `BedrockPhysicalMotionLifecycleTest`, `BedrockPlayerModesTest`, `BedrockVehiclePredictionsTest`, `VehiclePredictionPayloadTest`.

Native and live controls establish selected movement, correction, and flight behavior. Water-edge falls, uncommon mounts, network conditions, and mixed mechanics remain open.

The [owning patch](0025-send-completed-local-physics-to-viabedrock.patch) retains implementation rationale and versioned evidence.
