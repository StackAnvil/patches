# feat(inventory): present authored native containers

## Purpose

Bind authored container geometry to authoritative Java menus, slots and cursor state without changing inventory request ownership.

## Design constraints

Bind authored geometry and controls to the actual menu, cursor, slots, connection, and opening token. Keep request ownership in core and use ordinary screens when required components are unavailable.

Prerequisites:

- viafabricplus-bedrock/0029-share-native-ui-scene-rendering.patch: Land shared scene and GUI actor rendering before container presentation.

## Validation and remaining limits

Regression coverage includes `BedrockNativeContainerScreenTest`, `NativeContainerButtonTest`, `NativeContainerGeometryTest`, `NativeContainerInputTest`.

Widget, lifecycle, and recorded menu controls cover admitted scenes. Complete player/cooking integration, live transfers, and the original E-key background report remain unresolved.

The [owning patch](0029-present-authored-native-containers.patch) retains implementation rationale and versioned evidence.
