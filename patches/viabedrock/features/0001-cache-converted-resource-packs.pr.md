## Review focus

Please check that a changed source pack cannot reuse an older conversion, and that reconnecting with unchanged packs avoids another conversion.

## Testing

- [x] Run `./gradlew test checkstyleMain checkstyleTest` on the feature-only checkout.
- [x] Join Bedrock Dedicated Server 1.26.51.1 with a resource pack, reconnect, and confirm the converted pack is reused.
- [x] Change the pack texture and version, then confirm a new conversion contains the changed bytes and the Java client loads it.
- [x] Join the same server with Fabulously Optimized after the cache checks.

The live joins used the full StackAnvil patch stack and a local ViaProxy build compatible with the current ViaBedrock API.
