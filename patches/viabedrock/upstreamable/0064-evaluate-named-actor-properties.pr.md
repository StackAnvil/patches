Evaluate named actor properties before render controller selection. Saved CubeCraft controllers require string enum comparison and correct assignment and unary precedence. The shared Molang evaluator also supplies Geyser custom block permutations.

Validation: semantic parser/property regressions and the full 246-test ViaBedrock suite pass. Typed wire decoding stays in the existing metadata patch.

Carry resolved materials, `ignore_lighting`, and the evaluated floating light multiplier in each selected actor model. Material arrays resolve in the controller scope. Preserve wildcard and bone override order for the client renderer. A saved Bedrock 1.26.51.1 Hive logo requires the unlit controller input; CubeConverter supplies the source fields. Target protocol is 2193.

Validation: material selection tests cover named bindings, array choices, override order, immutable snapshots, and lighting state changes. The complete ViaBedrock build passes, including Checkstyle.
