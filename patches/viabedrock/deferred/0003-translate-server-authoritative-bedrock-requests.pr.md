# Server-authoritative inventory requests

This patch follows the inventory work owned by [ViaBedrock #276](https://github.com/ViaVersionAddons/ViaBedrock/pull/276).
It remains deferred until that prerequisite lands.

## Crafted item metadata

A successful stack response supplies counts, names, and stack network IDs.
It omits complete item tags and the item's final subtype.
A crafted map can therefore retain a preview UUID after the response assigns its new stack ID.

Core identifies transfers from `CreatedOutputContainer` and correlates their destinations with the response.
An `InventoryMismatch` transaction requests full inventory data while the workstation remains open.
Queued interactions wait for matching destination IDs and counts and complete player, cursor, armor, and offhand snapshots.
Later snapshots can invalidate an earlier matching update.
This barrier prevents queued predictions from running between snapshots of the same refresh.
The existing inventory recovery handles a refresh timeout.

The [target inventory transaction schema](https://mojang.github.io/bedrock-protocol-docs/1.26.51/packets/inventory-transaction-packet/) documents the transaction union.
The [map-copy schema](https://mojang.github.io/bedrock-protocol-docs/1.26.51/packets/map-create-locked-copy-packet/) documents the preview map identity request.
Numeric values and response behavior come from the matching native build.

## Verification

- Native Bedrock 1.26.51.1, build 51061372, protocol 2193, with a matching dedicated server.
- An injected mismatch after an accepted map-locking craft returns full player, armor, HUD, offhand, and workstation contents.
- Cartography stays open. HUD slot zero contains the final map UUID and subtype; its UUID differs from the preview.
- A subsequent native placement succeeds using the refreshed item's acknowledged network ID.
- Five correlation tests cover final map metadata, stale IDs and amounts, wrong slots, multiple destinations, inventory aliases, and superseding snapshots.
- The complete ViaBedrock build and tests pass after replaying the 84-patch stack.

Raw captures and account data remain private.
This native comparison establishes the refresh mechanism.
Java UI integration, other server implementations, and direct and ViaProxy crafting comparisons remain unverified.
Cartography's Java screen and request generation remain incomplete.

## Recovery refresh

A request timeout now sends `InventoryMismatch` after reopening the player inventory.
The old recovery path reopened the inventory without requesting the cursor and equipment snapshots that its barrier requires.
It now shares the refresh transaction used for crafted metadata.
The native comparison above establishes that this transaction returns all required containers on Bedrock 1.26.51.1.
The barrier and disconnect timeout remain active if the server cannot supply fresh state.
The report lacks the original server and request log.
This change fixes a recovery defect, but the original timeout trigger remains unknown.
The complete core build passes with 557 passing tests and five optional skips, including the inventory recovery and crafted-item synchronization tests.
