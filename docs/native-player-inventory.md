# Native player inventory

This reference supports the remaining player-inventory implementation. It describes the target renderer and the current Java integration gaps.

## Current integration

Release 0.3.53 synchronizes player-inventory preferences and preserves independent inventory and workbench layouts.
The E-key path still opens Java's inventory screen.
The native inventory asset requires `live_player_renderer`, armor and crafting collections, recipe controls, tabs and search.
The shared Java renderer currently supports `live_horse_renderer` and actor portraits. It does not support `live_player_renderer`.

## Target and original functions

The reference uses Bedrock 1.26.51.1, build 51061372, protocol 2193.
The binary SHA-256 is `537c0aee2e79afbdc94b44b28e00f466ae62bc50e2733d953b430db9dbaa9ee7`.

| Function or component | Address or identifier | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Live player draw | `0x148ddd910` | Reads the local actor and constructs the preview |
| Cursor delta helper | `0x148de0020` | Reads `#look_at_cursor` and the current input source |
| Body-yaw getter | `0x14207f2b0` | Reads current and previous body yaw |
| Body-yaw setter | `0x14204d890` | Writes current and previous body yaw |
| Actor rotation | Actor offset `0x228` | Stores pitch and yaw separately from yaw history |
| Body-yaw history | Component hash `0xd7f64bba` | Stores two body-yaw values |
| Head-yaw history | Component hash `0xbabe7211` | Stores two head-yaw values |

The renderer factory selects different draw functions for live player and horse controls.
The live player draw uses the local actor directly. It does not select an actor through the horse control's `#entity_id`.

## Framing and pose

The control center determines the preview position. The smaller control dimension determines its scale.
The actor rotation, body-yaw history and head-yaw history remain separate throughout the draw.

| Native state | Preview behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Standing | Uses the control center and the smaller dimension |
| Swimming or crawling | Moves the preview center upward by 20 logical units |
| Gliding | Moves the center downward by 15 units, uses 60% scale and a fixed 10-degree tilt |

Gliding takes precedence over swimming and crawling. Its actor rotation remains unchanged.
Its body yaw becomes zero, while its head yaw retains the difference between the original head and body values.

For ordinary poses, cursor deltas use the control center minus the cursor position.
Their angles use `atan(delta / 40)`.
The pitch multiplier is `-20`, the actor/head-yaw multiplier is `40`, and the body-yaw multiplier is `20`.

The cursor helper requires a true boolean `#look_at_cursor` property.
Raw input mode `1` reads the native mouse coordinates and GUI scale.
Other captured modes use a separate cursor object and two admission getters.
An absent or inactive cursor contributes zero deltas.
The admission getters' physical producers remain unverified.

The draw temporarily changes the admitted mount's body yaw too.
The normal return restores actor rotation, both yaw histories and the mount's body yaw.

## Executed reference and limits

The private reference executes 672 original draw calls through normal return with an absent renderer result.
It covers seven pose combinations, three control shapes, eight cursor configurations, mount presence and head-yaw component presence.
The original sparse component lookups, body-yaw getter/setter, matrix arithmetic and restoration instructions execute.
Every case restores the supplied player and mount values.

The fixture supplies local actor delivery, flags, cursor admission values, matrix-stack bookkeeping and renderer-context boundaries.
Host float math supplies `atanf`, `sinf` and `cosf`.
The absent renderer result skips successful renderer submission, renderer variables and effects.
The reference does not establish GPU output, clipping, physical input delivery or visible native parity.

The Java port must retain separate pose values and isolate preview state from world state.
It also needs checks through the real GUI entity submission path.
The full player-inventory controller, screen lifecycle and input delivery remain unfinished.
All five implementation areas and the four original bug reports remain open.
