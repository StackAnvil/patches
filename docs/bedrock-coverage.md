# Bedrock coverage ledger

This reference tracks the full Bedrock coverage goal for contributors.
The target is Bedrock 1.26.51.1, build 51061372, network protocol 2193, and Java 26.3.
The baseline review date is October 3, 2026.

## Status and evidence

- **Implemented** means a production path exists. It does not establish native parity.
- **Verified** means evidence establishes the behavior and connection routes named in that row.
- **Incomplete** means required behavior is missing or partial.
- **Unverified** means an implementation lacks sufficient native or integration evidence.

No complete area currently has verified Bedrock parity.
Tests for a decoder, sampled graph, or submitted vertices establish only those boundaries.
Visible rendering, timing, audio, and account flows require their own comparisons.
An unreviewed requirement remains incomplete until evidence establishes its status.

## Architecture and connection routes

ViaBedrock owns packet decoding, authoritative state, inventory, asset processing, and standard Java translation.
The client add-on handles behavior that requires custom rendering, camera controls, or input integration.
ViaProxy must carry the state and resources that these integrations need.

Each feature must record results for direct connections and ViaProxy.
Ordinary Java clients use standard translations where those translations reproduce the required behavior.
A fallback does not establish native parity.

## Protocol inventory

The complete applied source defines 168 inbound packet types.
There are 104 explicit registrations, 20 explicit cancellations, and 44 automatic fallback cancellations.
These counts describe source registration, not feature completion.
The inventory excludes commented enum entries and includes transition registrations.

| ID | Requirement | Status | Remaining evidence or work |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P1 | Every inbound packet and field | Incomplete | Audit registered handlers for discarded fields and implement applicable missing behavior. |
| P2 | Every outbound packet and field | Incomplete | Audit request generation, flags, enum values, state transitions, and native client ordering. |
| P3 | Target packets absent from enums | Incomplete | Compare definitions with protocol 2193. Later preview packets do not establish target support. |
| P4 | Intentional exclusions | Incomplete | Record versioned evidence for each telemetry, Education, platform, or obsolete exclusion. |

The [source guide](bedrock-development-sources.md) defines the version and enum research process.

## Inventory and editors

| ID | Requirement | Status | Remaining evidence or work |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| I1 | Cartography creation, extension, cloning, locking, locator conversion, and naming | Incomplete | Multi-recipe IDs now survive decoding. Implement the screen and crafting flows, and resolve authoritative map results. |
| I2 | Structure and jigsaw editors | Incomplete | Implement screens, requests, structure responses, and jigsaw data. |
| I3 | Stonecutter recipe updates | Incomplete | Handle server recipe selection and complete result and close behavior. |
| I4 | Trading and loom | Implemented | Preserve their tested request and response paths. Complete remaining native and inventory edge comparisons. |
| I5 | Every container operation | Incomplete | Audit bulk transfer, acknowledgments, rejection recovery, closing, reconciliation, and legacy inventory paths. |

Native protocol 2193 captures establish cartography input slots 12 and 13, result slot 50, and `CraftRecipeOptional` requests.
Cloning produces two maps and consumes one item from each input.
Naming uses the request's filter strings and `CartographyText` origin.
These captures do not establish the Java implementation.

The decoder tests retain known and unknown recipe UUIDs and unsigned network IDs.
They also establish following-array alignment and truncated input rejection.
The [codec notes](../patches/viabedrock/deferred/0022-define-bedrock-request-and-recipe-codecs.pr.md#dynamic-recipes) record their evidence and build results.

## Cameras and UI

| ID | Requirement | Status | Remaining evidence or work |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| U1 | Presets, instructions, splines, shake, and aim assistance | Incomplete | Implement packet state, client behavior, lifecycle, and ViaProxy transport. |
| U2 | Fog and HUD visibility | Incomplete | Apply server updates and restore state after removal or disconnect. |
| U3 | Texture animations, toasts, credits, store requests, and inventory preferences | Incomplete | Implement target packet behavior and verify native presentation. |
| U4 | Dynamic JSON UI and widgets | Incomplete | Extend static sidebar support with expression evaluation and applicable widgets. |
| U5 | NPC conversations, portraits, links, and editing | Incomplete | Core Java conversations exist. Native portraits, editing, link captures, and UI comparisons remain. |

## Gameplay and entities

| ID | Requirement | Status | Remaining evidence or work |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| G1 | Input locks | Incomplete | Preserve server permissions and apply movement and camera restrictions. |
| G2 | Movement effects and prediction corrections | Incomplete | Implement missing packets and compare translated movement timing with the native client. |
| G3 | Voxel shapes | Incomplete | Decode shape updates and apply collision and selection behavior. |
| G4 | Animation commands, entity overrides, mob properties, and equipment updates | Incomplete | Connect server updates to authoritative state and runtime playback. |
| G5 | Movement attributes and attack/use prediction | Incomplete | Apply ignored movement attributes and complete native input and cooldown behavior. |
| G6 | Interaction and entity metadata | Incomplete | Audit variant mappings, interactions, flags, properties, and unsupported metadata. |

## Resources, animation, particles, and audio

| ID | Requirement | Status | Remaining evidence or work |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R1 | General actor controllers and scripts | Incomplete | Complete transitions, weighted entries, variables, events, queries, and render-controller selection. |
| R2 | Server particle dispatch | Incomplete | Retain actor identity and Molang variables, then route effects into native playback through both connection routes. |
| R3 | Particle runtime | Incomplete | Complete components, actor contexts, child effects, concurrency, and visible lifecycle comparisons. |
| R4 | Server audio | Incomplete | Retain handles, loops, playback position, and range behavior. Complete supported controls, captions, and audible comparisons. |
| R5 | Custom block geometry and lighting | Incomplete | Complete rotated nonuniform scale, legacy texture variation, and directional light occlusion. |
| R6 | Equipped attachables | Incomplete | Transport graphs through ViaProxy. Complete variants, explicit bindings, per-bone materials, and material families. |

The attachable matrix tests establish supported same-name affine bindings.
They do not establish explicit binding expressions or complete native equipment parity.

## Skins, persona, and Dressing Room

| ID | Requirement | Status | Remaining evidence or work |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| S1 | Animated face composition and native tint blending | Unverified | Existing production paths need broader native face, channel, mask, and outfit comparisons. |
| S2 | Complete local persona assembly | Incomplete | Resolve unavailable free assets and remaining geometry, layering, and animation sources. |
| S3 | Classic geometry and animation formats | Incomplete | Complete inherited legacy sources, aliases, metadata, and inheritance comparisons. |
| S4 | Emotes and animation fidelity | Incomplete | Complete unavailable remote assets, events, effects, platform filters, timing, rotations, and scale comparisons. |
| S5 | Native first-person and held-item drawing | Incomplete | Submit sampled native geometry and complete charging, equip, swing, equipment, and input timing. |
| D1 | Palettes, color channels, and limb editing | Unverified | Compare remaining palette options, asynchronous saves, and fresh native limb edits. |
| D2 | Classic packs and imported-skin synchronization | Incomplete | Complete imported images without downloadable pack references and remaining account/platform flows. |
| D3 | Catalog acquisition, purchases, redemption, and wallet | Incomplete | Complete acquisition and interactive Store behavior with native account comparisons. |
| D4 | Multiplayer synchronization | Unverified | Compare live changes, height, arm width, faces, capes, outfits, and remote emotes on additional clients. |

The [skin flow](skin-flow.md#missing-features) records detailed implementation evidence and outstanding comparisons.
Its verification section preserves the original skin and persona scope.

## Independent assets and platforms

| ID | Requirement | Status | Remaining evidence or work |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A1 | Licensed acquisition, decryption, extraction, archives, and versioned caching | Implemented | Preserve successful Linux acquisition without a local installation. Complete unavailable account assets and remaining platform checks. |
| A2 | No production dependency on a local Bedrock installation | Unverified | Audit every asset path and integration, including defaults and fallback behavior. |
| A3 | Supported operating systems and connection routes | Unverified | Verify helper runtime, login, assets, rendering, and account flows on Windows and macOS. |

Credentials, licenses, keys, native assets, raw captures, and screenshots remain outside Git.

## Completion gate

Every applicable requirement needs production behavior and evidence that matches its scope.
Each exclusion needs evidence for the pinned version.
Direct and ViaProxy results must name any required client integration.
The goal remains active while any required row is incomplete or unverified.
