# Native cooking action reference

This reference records verified behavior for contributors who implement authored furnace, smoker, and blast-furnace controls.
The cooking action backend and authored controls remain unfinished.
The current client receives cooking snapshots and progress while ordinary Java screens handle gameplay.

## Version and evidence

The reference executable is Bedrock 1.26.51.1, build 51061372, protocol 2193.
Private fixtures execute original instructions with controlled menu data and explicit external boundaries.
Licensed binaries, captured data, and fixture outputs remain outside this repository.
The [Bedrock source guide](bedrock-development-sources.md) explains source selection and version checks.

| Check | Cases or registrations | Established behavior |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Transfer quantity decoder | 1,638 cases | Descriptor domains, signed bounds, byte narrowing, and rejected values |
| Cooking selection predicate and ingredient matcher | 2,160 cases | Ingredient matching, fallback access, and recipe-collection rejection |
| Base and cooking state registrations | 94 plus 7 registrations | Callback identities and registration order |
| Native state storage | 101 registrations | Higher priorities run first. Equal priorities retain registration order. |
| Selected-recipe release | 90 cases | Exit conditions, actual base-state reset, and handled result |
| Initial-state recipe dispatch | 1,620 cases | Command, held-item, source-permission, and controlled input-mode conditions |
| Cooking item-return planner | 1,500 cases | Original-slot deficits and the remaining count passed to auto-placement |

These checks cover different boundaries. Their case counts do not measure native gameplay or visual parity.

## Recipe command dispatch

The authored commands are `button.recipe_select`, `button.recipe_secondary`, and `button.recipe_tertiary`.
Their names identify input commands. They do not specify transfer quantities.

The native controller starts in internal state `1`. Recipe selection uses state `25`.
These state numbers belong to the UI controller, not the network protocol.

For valid recipe indices and input-mode field values `0`, `1`, or `3`, the initial-state fixture establishes these rules:

- Primary command at event phase `0` enters recipe selection when the held item is empty and the source permits selection.
- Secondary and tertiary commands do not enter recipe selection in these cases.
- A nonempty held item prevents that primary transition.
- In selected-recipe state `25`, primary or secondary at phase `2` returns to state `1`.
- Other tested phases and the tertiary command leave selected-recipe state unchanged.

The release transition executes the real base-state reset and returns handled bit `4`.
The fixtures do not establish physical input-mode mappings or how Java mouse events produce native event phases.
The mode-`2` path and complete input callback pipeline still need verification.
Negative-index cases are internal controls. They do not authorize invalid recipe identities.

Inherited container rules precede the cooking rule at equal priority.
The implementation must preserve that ordering instead of treating every recipe command as an immediate transfer.

## Selection and ingredient placement

The selection predicate checks the physical ingredient first.
When the native air check rejects that item, the predicate reads the controller fallback.
It compares the item with the clicked output's accepted ingredient alternatives using full native item matching.

A matching ingredient takes the selection-only branch.
That branch updates the selected output without invoking ingredient auto-placement.
The other branch can return previous ingredients and collect ingredients for the new selection.

Action sources and availability sources differ:

| Use | Native collection IDs |
| --- | --- |
| Ingredient auto-placement sources | Fuel `24`, hotbar `28`, inventory `29` |
| Availability sources | Ingredient `25`, fuel `24`, hotbar `28`, inventory `29`, and optional cursor `59` |

The action source vector does not include the cursor.
Held-item handling belongs to the controller dispatch path.
The existing Java recipe-book planner has separate quantity and placement behavior.
It cannot establish native action parity.

## Transfer quantities

The shared `NativeTransferQuantity` decoder receives an available count after the executor resolves source validity and any maximum-stack lookup.
It narrows that count to an unsigned byte before applying the descriptor.

| Kind | Value | Selected count |
| ---: | ---: | --- |
| `0` | Signed explicit count | Available count limited by the explicit count, with a minimum of zero |
| `1` | `0` | All available items |
| `1` | `1` | Half, rounded upward |
| `1` | `2` | One |
| `2` | `0` | All available items |
| `2` | `1` | One |

Unknown kinds and unsupported values select zero.
At this internal boundary, the one-item modes return one even for an available count of zero.
The executor's empty-source guard precedes the decoder.
Permissions, actual source count, destination capacity, mutation, and request encoding remain separate steps.

## Return previous ingredients

The return planner first examines stored source snapshots for hotbar and inventory slots.
It requires a matching stored item and either a compatible current destination or an empty destination.
It restores the deficit between the stored count and the current destination count, limited by the remaining ingredient count.
It then passes the remaining ingredient to generic auto-placement with an all-items descriptor.

The return fixture supplies transfer effects at explicit capacities and records the generic auto-placement call.
It does not execute generic auto-placement or establish the original snapshot producer's ordering.
The implementation must verify those parts before reusing this planner for native transactions.

## Implementation boundaries

The [shared UI patch](../patches/viabedrock/upstreamable/0095-share-native-ui-programs-and-resources.patch) owns the cooking messages, scene contracts, and presentation authority.
The [inventory request patch](../patches/viabedrock/deferred/0003-translate-server-authoritative-bedrock-requests.patch) owns request prediction, response reconciliation, and transfer quantities.

Remaining work includes the complete input pipeline, snapshot production, return and transfer execution, revision-bound action handling, and authored client controls.
Native visual comparisons remain separate from these instruction-level checks.
